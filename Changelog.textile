h1. Changelog for tabulatr

* Fixed <tt>:filter_width</tt> not working for <tt>select</tt> filters.
* Giving a Hash as <tt>:format</tt> option gives the corresponding value.
* We now allow column presets:
  <pre>
  Tabulatr.config do |config|
    #...
    config.column_presets({
    config.column_presets({
      :action_column => {:width => '100px'},
      :smallint => { :width =>  '55px', :filter_width =>  '30px', :align => 'right' },
      :id  =>      :smallint,
      :sid =>      { :width => '200px', :filter_width => '170px', :filter => :like },
      :title =>    { :filter => :like },
      :count =>    { :map => false, :width => '40px', :filter => false, :align => 'right' },
      :moo =>      { :width =>  '155px', :filter_width =>  '120px', :align => 'right' }
    })
  end
  </pre>

Now, every column will check whether there is as entry corresponding to its name in this table and get the content as 'default' options.

  <pre>
    <%= table_for @regions do |t|
      t.column :id
      t.column :sid
      # ...
    end %>
  </pre>

so, the :id column has all the options defined above. The :action_column entry is used for 'action' columns.

But even better, you can use arbitrary presets:

  <pre>
  t.column :foo, :preset => :moo
  </pre>

gets the :moo preset.

  @customers = Customer.find_for_table(params,
    name_mapping: {
      name: '("addresses"."firstname" || \' \' || "addresses"."lastname")',
